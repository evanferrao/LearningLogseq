- FLIP-FLOP A flip-flop circuit can maintain a binary state indefinitely (as long as power is delivered to the circuit) until directed by an input signal to switch states The major differences among various types of flip-flops are in the number of inputs they possess and in the manner in which the inputs affect the binary state BASIC
